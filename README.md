# CapBoy--2.0

This is a replica of a retro Pac Man styled game I have created while diving into the programming language Java. Built on the
text editor Eclipse I created this game over the course of two weeks. If you would like to play, simply clone this project
and open with Eclipse, IntelliJ, or any other Java text editor you might prefer. I hope you enjoy playing it more than I 
enjoyed making it! :-)
